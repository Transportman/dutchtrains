Dutch Trains for OpenTTD. It all starts with Arend in 1839 and continues 
to the ICNG and beyond. The set gives you the steam engines, 
diesel and electric engines, diesel and electric multiple units and

There are five parameter settings available. 
 1: Translates the vehicle nicknames to your own language, or English if

    they're not already disabled by a different NewGRF.
 3: Increase or decrease vehicle purchase costs.
 4: Increase or decrease vehicle running costs.
 5: Disable the track dependency for multisystem trains and only use the
    highest power.

2.4 Usage
---------
Starting date
    If you want to start at the dawn of Dutch railroading, you can start
    as early as 1839 with Arend.

Metro vehicles
    Metro vehicles are only available if you have loaded a metro track
    NewGRF. The train set has been tested to work with the Metro Track
    Set and the UK Railway Set tracks. Please note that recent versions
    of NuTracks do not contain metro tracks any more.
    
Multiple units
    Multiple units are purchased as a single complete unit. If MUs are
    available in multiple lengths, you choose the length directy from
    the purchase menu by selecting the appropriate train to purchase.
    You cannot change the length of a MU once purchased, in that case 
    you have to sell the train and buy an new one, or use autoreplace.
    
    Many of the older multiple units have a baggage compartment. This 
    compartment can be refitted to carry mail or any express cargo. By 
    default, the baggage compartment will carry either passengers or 
    nothing at all.
    
Livery refits
    The set comes with a comprehensive livery refit system. If a vehicle
    has multiple liveries available, you can refit it in the depot to 
    select a different livery. At any one time, all liveries are 
    available for refit, even if this is not historically accurate (it 
    is up to you to play realistic or not).
    For realistic play, most vehicles are equipped with a 
    "year-dependent livery" option. This is selected by default upon 
    vehicle purchase, and what this does is give you the livery that was
    common at the current (game) year. Sometimes even randomized, if 
    multiple liveries were common at the same time. If a new livery is 
    introduced as the years pass, the vehicles will be automatically 
    repainted when visiting a depot.
    If you rather have your vehicles always keep the livery they got 
    when you purchased the vehicle, then you can achieve this by 
    refitting to the "construction year livery". This can also be done 
    later on in case you forgot, the livery will then revert to the one 
    the train had upon purchase.
    A couple of modern engines don't have these options, but instead 
    come with a "random livery" refit option. In this case the game will
    pick a random livery from the available liveries for each vehicle.
    And of course all liveries are listed separately, selecting a 
    specific livery will make the vehicle always keep this livery.
    
    When livery-refitting, it's best to do this for each vehicle part
    individually. Refitting a complete train at once may not always give
    the expected result, but you can always try and then refit each part
    individually if you didn't get what you wanted.
    
    Note: all livery refits are marked as "Passengers" in the vehicle
    refit window. This is also the case for engines that don't actually
    have a capacity, due to game limitations. Even though it says 
    passengers, these engines will not hold anything after refitting.
    Think of the engineer being a person/passenger.

3 Known issues
--------------
    
Cargo wagon properties
    Cargo wagon properties like capacity, speed, weight etc. are 
    currently suboptimal and need to be reviewed (#3953)



------------------------
4 Background information
------------------------

We aim to provide nearly every train that ever ran on Dutch tracks for
any significant amount of time. This includes foreign trains that often
visit our country, but of course the very first train that roamed our 
tracks, the very new models, and everything inbetween.

The vehicle properties are kept as real as possible. So you get real
horsepowers, real weights, real maximum speeds and real capacities. For
trains this is the seated capacity, for metros we also allow standees.
We hope that this makes the trains feel as real as possible.

5 Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------

Q: Why is the livery refit of a second MU not possible?
A: This is a technical limitation that currently cannot be solved. It is
   not possible to provide both the livery refit and the baggage 
   compartment refit for MUs other than the first in the chain.

Q: Why is the random livery refit of an additional MU in a train always
   the same as the first of the same type?
A: This is a technical limitation that currently cannot be solved. Each
   vehicle in the chain reads the randomness of the first vehicle in the
   same chain. That is the only way to get all parts of the same MU to
   have the same random livery.
   
Q: Why do some MUs with a baggage compartment increase capacity when
   refitted to passengers, while others don't?
A: In real life, some MUs came in multiple variants, with and without
   baggage compartment. In this case, when refitted to passengers, you 
   will automatically get the version without the baggage compartment.
   In other cases, the baggage compartment was later rebuilt as 
   passenger compartment. If this is the case, then at some point the 
   vehicle capacity will increase when refitted to passengers.
   The last case is that the baggage compartment was never used to 
   carry passengers. In this case, the compartment will remain empty
   when refitted to passengers.
   
Q: Why are some wagon types not available?
A: Some specialized wagons, like the VAM compost wagon, the 
   cartransporter and the superheavy flatcar are only able to carry 
   specialized cargoes. These cargoes are not available without an 
   industry NewGRF, and these wagons are not available if the cargoes 
   they carry are not available.

Q: Can I use Autorefit?
A: Yes.

Q: Why have some newer trains less power when purchased than stated in
   the purchase menu?
A: These are so-called multi-current trains. When a trackset is loaded
   that provides tracks which correspond with 25 kV AC tracks these 
   trains have their power depend on the track they are on. When there 
   is no such track detected or when the Variable power parameter is set
   to "Always highest power" these trains always get full power 
   independent of the track they are on.

Q: Why is there a question mark or dagger symbol in front of the loading 
   time in the purchase menu details?
A: This is due to a bug in OpenTTD. Use OpenTTD 1.4.2-RC2 or newer
   to resolve it. It does not harm gameplay.
